The source code includes several files needed to build the project. I have left hints to where code needs to be added. Check for "implement this".

Finally, you can run the code by calling

java IRTester <pathtodir>

Here <pathtodir> specifies the path of the directory containing the text files to be processed. For example, run

java IRTester "/home/user/project/dataset" 

if your text files are stored in the directory /home/user/project/dataset.
